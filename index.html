                   <P>Our App was made for people trying to get out and find breweries near them! This will also give them the name, address, and URL of the brewery!

                    There is a search bar where a user can search for a brewery name, city, or even state and get a list of Breweries from an API. They can use this to navigate to the brewery's website!
                    
                    Local Storage is also saved, and displayed on the page, which allows users to see their search history.
                    
                    There is an About Us page which would show the contact information, and team that went into building the application
                    
                    There is a Mission/Vision/Values page which lets users know our mission in completing this application
                     
                    There is also a Contact Us page which shows a Google Maps layout of where we are located, and also how to contact us! demo "https://saurabh5612.github.io/FoodDashAPP/"</P>
